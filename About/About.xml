--- Original Description ---
Description
This mod simply allows pawn's to shoot anything in an adjacent tile. It removes the "(too close)" message when right-clicking an enemy and automatically lets them shoot without your interaction also. It'll most likely affect enemy pawn's too.

You can configure every gun (including modded) to abide by this rule or be exempt from it in the mod settings. Requires HugsLib! Special thanks to "roolo" on Steam for letting me use his code from RunAndGun!

Rant
Fed up with your pawn's throwing down their weapons when attacked by someone with a melee weapon?
Fed up with your pawn's not taking the advantage?
Fed up with "you've brought a knife to a gun fight" not having any weight in Rimworld?
Fed up with your pawn's acting like their f***ing weapon isn't much more efficient and lethal at point blank?!

Me too. You don't see police officers throwing down their weapons when lunged at by a knife-wielding maniac and you don't see guns advertised as infamously weak at point blank range (a term CREATED because of its associated lethality). So I made this mod and now your pawns will gun down invaders by any means necessary - regardless of if it's fair or not.

Compatibility
This should work with basically everything. I don't see how it could ever be incompatible with something else but do let me know if it is!
It's 1000% safe to add and remove from existing saves.
Terms and Conditions apply - I'm not liable for death, torture, slavery or imprisonment as a result of you manically running in with a crowbar and being gunned down.

Support
If you like or use my mods, consider buying me a coffee on ko-fi. It'll speed up the delivery of updates, any future mods I've got planned and generally motivate me to make more!</description>
